ict gait database



1.gait does not support index.asp,,only support index.html

2.directory "data#120sun" was changed to "data-120sun" when uploading and committing to github.
  so when normal using after download all the source codes, the folder "data-120sun" should be changed to "data#120sun".
  
3.When normal using after download, index.html is not needed(it's only for github http webserver).
